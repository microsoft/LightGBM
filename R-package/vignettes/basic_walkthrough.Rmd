## Introduction

Welcome to the world of [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a highly efficient gradient boosting implementation (Ke et al. 2017).

```{r}
library(lightgbm)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
# limit number of threads used, to be respectful of CRAN's resources when it checks this vignette
data.table::setDTthreads(1L)
setLGBMthreads(2L)
```

This vignette will guide you through its basic usage. It will show how to build a simple binary classification model based on a subset of the `bank` dataset (Moro, Cortez, and Rita 2014). You will use the two input features "age" and "balance" to predict whether a client has subscribed a term deposit.

## The dataset

The dataset looks as follows.

```{r}
data(bank, package = "lightgbm")

bank[1L:5L, c("y", "age", "balance")]

# Distribution of the response
table(bank$y)
```

## Training the model

The R package of LightGBM offers two functions to train a model:

- `lgb.train()`: This is the main training logic. It offers full flexibility but requires a `Dataset` object created by the `lgb.Dataset()` function.
- `lightgbm()`: Simpler, but less flexible. Data can be passed without having to bother with `lgb.Dataset()`.

### Using the `lightgbm()` function

In a first step, you need to convert data to numeric. Afterwards, you are ready to fit the model by the `lightgbm()` function.

```{r}
# Numeric response and feature matrix
y <- as.numeric(bank$y == "yes")
X <- data.matrix(bank[, c("age", "balance")])

# Train
fit <- lightgbm(
  data = X
  , label = y
  , params = list(
    num_leaves = 4L
    , learning_rate = 1.0
    , objective = "binary"
  )
  , nrounds = 10L
  , verbose = -1L
)

# Result
summary(predict(fit, X))
```

It seems to have worked! And the predictions are indeed probabilities between 0 and 1.

### Using the `lgb.train()` function

Alternatively, you can go for the more flexible interface `lgb.train()`. Here, as an additional step, you need to prepare `y` and `X` by the data API `lgb.Dataset()` of LightGBM. Parameters are passed to `lgb.train()` as a named list.

```{r}
# Data interface
dtrain <- lgb.Dataset(X, label = y)

# Parameters
params <- list(
  objective = "binary"
  , num_leaves = 4L
  , learning_rate = 1.0
)

# Train
fit <- lgb.train(
  params
  , data = dtrain
  , nrounds = 10L
  , verbose = -1L
)
```

Try it out! If stuck, visit LightGBM's [documentation](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/R/index.html) for more details.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
# Cleanup
if (file.exists("lightgbm.model")) {
  file.remove("lightgbm.model")
}
```
