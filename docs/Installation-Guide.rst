Installation Guide
==================

This is a guide for building the LightGBM Command Line Interface (CLI). If you want to build the Python-package or R-package please refer to `Python-package`_ and `R-package`_ folders respectively.

All instructions below are aimed at compiling the 64-bit version of LightGBM.
It is worth compiling the 32-bit version only in very rare special cases involving environmental limitations.
The 32-bit version is slow and untested, so use it at your own risk and don't forget to adjust some of the commands below when installing.

If you need to build a static library instead of a shared one, you can add ``-DBUILD_STATIC_LIB=ON`` to CMake flags.

Users who want to perform benchmarking can make LightGBM output time costs for different internal routines by adding ``-DUSE_TIMETAG=ON`` to CMake flags.

It is possible to build LightGBM in debug mode. In this mode all compiler optimizations are disabled and LightGBM performs more checks internally. To enable debug mode you can add ``-DUSE_DEBUG=ON`` to CMake flags or choose ``Debug_*`` configuration (e.g. ``Debug_DLL``, ``Debug_mpi``) in Visual Studio depending on how you are building LightGBM.

.. _sanitizers:

In addition to the debug mode, LightGBM can be built with compiler sanitizers.
To enable them add ``-DUSE_SANITIZER=ON -DENABLED_SANITIZERS="address;leak;undefined"`` to CMake flags.
These values refer to the following supported sanitizers:

- ``address`` - AddressSanitizer (ASan);
- ``leak`` - LeakSanitizer (LSan);
- ``undefined`` - UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSan);
- ``thread`` - ThreadSanitizer (TSan).

Please note, that ThreadSanitizer cannot be used together with other sanitizers.
For more info and additional sanitizers' parameters please refer to the `following docs`_.
It is very useful to build `C++ unit tests <#build-c-unit-tests>`__ with sanitizers.

.. _nightly-builds:

You can also download the artifacts of the latest successful build on master branch (nightly builds) here: |download artifacts|.

Build GPU Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linux
^^^^^

On Linux a GPU version of LightGBM (``device_type=gpu``) can be built using **OpenCL**, **Boost**, **CMake** and **gcc** or **Clang**.

The following dependencies should be installed before compilation:

-  **OpenCL** 1.2 headers and libraries, which is usually provided by GPU manufacture.

   The generic OpenCL ICD packages (for example, Debian package ``ocl-icd-libopencl1`` and ``ocl-icd-opencl-dev``) can also be used.

-  **libboost** 1.56 or later (1.61 or later is recommended).

   We use Boost.Compute as the interface to GPU, which is part of the Boost library since version 1.61. However, since we include the source code of Boost.Compute as a submodule, we only require the host has Boost 1.56 or later installed. We also use Boost.Align for memory allocation. Boost.Compute requires Boost.System and Boost.Filesystem to store offline kernel cache.

   The following Debian packages should provide necessary Boost libraries: ``libboost-dev``, ``libboost-system-dev``, ``libboost-filesystem-dev``.

-  **CMake** 3.2 or later.

To build LightGBM GPU version, run the following commands:

.. code:: sh

  git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM
  cd LightGBM
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DUSE_GPU=1 ..
  # if you have installed NVIDIA CUDA to a customized location, you should specify paths to OpenCL headers and library like the following:
  # cmake -DUSE_GPU=1 -DOpenCL_LIBRARY=/usr/local/cuda/lib64/libOpenCL.so -DOpenCL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/cuda/include/ ..
  make -j4

**Note**: glibc >= 2.14 is required.

**Note**: In some rare cases you may need to install OpenMP runtime library separately (use your package manager and search for ``lib[g|i]omp`` for doing this).

Windows
^^^^^^^

On Windows a GPU version of LightGBM (``device_type=gpu``) can be built using **OpenCL**, **Boost**, **CMake** and **VS Build Tools** or **MinGW**.

If you use **MinGW**, the build procedure is similar to the build on Linux. Refer to `GPU Windows Compilation <./GPU-Windows.rst>`__ to get more details.

Following procedure is for the **MSVC** (Microsoft Visual C++) build.

1. Install `Git for Windows`_, `CMake`_ (3.8 or higher) and `VS Build Tools`_ (**VS Build Tools** is not needed if **Visual Studio** (2015 or newer) is installed).

2. Install **OpenCL** for Windows. The installation depends on the brand (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel) of your GPU card.

   - For running on Intel, get `Intel SDK for OpenCL`_.

   - For running on AMD, get AMD APP SDK.

   - For running on NVIDIA, get `CUDA Toolkit`_.

   Further reading and correspondence table: `GPU SDK Correspondence and Device Targeting Table <./GPU-Targets.rst>`__.

3. Install `Boost Binaries`_.

   **Note**: Match your Visual C++ version:

   Visual Studio 2015 -> ``msvc-14.0-64.exe``,

   Visual Studio 2017 -> ``msvc-14.1-64.exe``,

   Visual Studio 2019 -> ``msvc-14.2-64.exe``,

   Visual Studio 2022 -> ``msvc-14.3-64.exe``.

4. Run the following commands:

   .. code:: console

     git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM
     cd LightGBM
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake -A x64 -DUSE_GPU=1 -DBOOST_ROOT=C:/local/boost_1_63_0 -DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR=C:/local/boost_1_63_0/lib64-msvc-14.0 ..
     # if you have installed NVIDIA CUDA to a customized location, you should specify paths to OpenCL headers and library like the following:
     # cmake -A x64 -DUSE_GPU=1 -DBOOST_ROOT=C:/local/boost_1_63_0 -DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR=C:/local/boost_1_63_0/lib64-msvc-14.0 -DOpenCL_LIBRARY="C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v10.0/lib/x64/OpenCL.lib" -DOpenCL_INCLUDE_DIR="C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v10.0/include" ..
     cmake --build . --target ALL_BUILD --config Release

   **Note**: ``C:/local/boost_1_63_0`` and ``C:/local/boost_1_63_0/lib64-msvc-14.0`` are locations of your **Boost** binaries (assuming you've downloaded 1.63.0 version for Visual Studio 2015).

Docker
^^^^^^

Refer to `GPU Docker folder <https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/tree/master/docker/gpu>`__.

Build CUDA Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `original GPU build <#build-gpu-version>`__ of LightGBM (``device_type=gpu``) is based on OpenCL.

The CUDA-based build (``device_type=cuda``) is a separate implementation and requires an NVIDIA graphics card with compute capability 6.0 and higher. It should be considered experimental, and we suggest using it only when it is impossible to use OpenCL version (for example, on IBM POWER microprocessors).

**Note**: only Linux is supported, other operating systems are not supported yet.

Linux
^^^^^

On Linux a CUDA version of LightGBM can be built using **CUDA**, **CMake** and **gcc** or **Clang**.

The following dependencies should be installed before compilation:

-  **CUDA** 10.0 or later libraries. Please refer to `this detailed guide`_. Pay great attention to the minimum required versions of host compilers listed in the table from that guide and use only recommended versions of compilers.

-  **CMake** 3.16 or later.

To build LightGBM CUDA version, run the following commands:

.. code:: sh

  git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM
  cd LightGBM
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DUSE_CUDA=1 ..
  make -j4

**Note**: glibc >= 2.14 is required.

**Note**: In some rare cases you may need to install OpenMP runtime library separately (use your package manager and search for ``lib[g|i]omp`` for doing this).

Build HDFS Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HDFS version of LightGBM was tested on CDH-5.14.4 cluster.

Linux
^^^^^

On Linux a HDFS version of LightGBM can be built using **CMake** and **gcc**.

1. Install `CMake`_.

2. Run the following commands:

   .. code:: sh

     git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM
     cd LightGBM
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake -DUSE_HDFS=ON ..
     # if you have installed HDFS to a customized location, you should specify paths to HDFS headers (hdfs.h) and library (libhdfs.so) like the following:
     # cmake \
     #   -DUSE_HDFS=ON \
     #   -DHDFS_LIB="/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-5.14.4-1.cdh5.14.4.p0.3/lib64/libhdfs.so" \
     #   -DHDFS_INCLUDE_DIR="/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-5.14.4-1.cdh5.14.4.p0.3/include/" \
     #   ..
     make -j4

**Note**: glibc >= 2.14 is required.

**Note**: In some rare cases you may need to install OpenMP runtime library separately (use your package manager and search for ``lib[g|i]omp`` for doing this).

Build Java Wrapper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the following instructions you can generate a JAR file containing the LightGBM `C API <./Development-Guide.rst#c-api>`__ wrapped by **SWIG**.

Windows
^^^^^^^

Build C++ Unit Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows
^^^^^^^

On Windows, C++ unit tests of LightGBM can be built using **CMake** and **VS Build Tools**.

1. Install `Git for Windows`_, `CMake`_ (3.8 or higher) and `VS Build Tools`_ (**VS Build Tools** is not needed if **Visual Studio** (2015 or newer) is already installed).

2. Run the following commands:

   .. code:: console

     git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM
     cd LightGBM
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake -A x64 -DBUILD_CPP_TEST=ON -DUSE_OPENMP=OFF ..
     cmake --build . --target testlightgbm --config Debug

The ``.exe`` file will be in ``LightGBM/Debug`` folder.

Linux
^^^^^

On Linux a C++ unit tests of LightGBM can be built using **CMake** and **gcc** or **Clang**.

1. Install `CMake`_.

2. Run the following commands:

   .. code:: sh

     git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM
     cd LightGBM
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake -DBUILD_CPP_TEST=ON -DUSE_OPENMP=OFF ..
     make testlightgbm -j4

**Note**: glibc >= 2.14 is required.
