Installation
------------

Preparation
'''''''''''

32-bit Python is not supported.
Please install 64-bit version.
If you have a strong need to install with 32-bit Python, refer to `Build 32-bit Version with 32-bit Python section <#build-32-bit-version-with-32-bit-python>`__.

|

Install from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/lightgbm>`_
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

.. code:: sh

    pip install lightgbm

Compiled library that is included in the wheel file supports both **GPU** (don't confuse with CUDA version) and **CPU** versions out of the box.
This feature is available only for **Windows** and **Linux** currently.
To use **GPU** version you only need to install OpenCL Runtime libraries.
For NVIDIA and AMD GPU they are included in the ordinary drivers for your graphics card, so no action is required.
If you would like your AMD or Intel CPU to act like a GPU (for testing and debugging),
you can install `AMD APP SDK <https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/releases/download/v2.0.12/AMD-APP-SDKInstaller-v3.0.130.135-GA-windows-F-x64.exe>`_ on **Windows** and `PoCL <https://portablecl.org>`_ on **Linux**.
Many modern Linux distributions provide packages for PoCL, look for ``pocl-opencl-icd`` on Debian-based distributions and ``pocl`` on RedHat-based distributions.

For **Windows** users, `VC runtime <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads>`_ is needed if **Visual Studio** is not installed.

For **macOS** users, the **OpenMP** library is needed.
You can install it by the following command: ``brew install libomp``.

If you get any errors during installation or due to any other reasons,
you may want to build dynamic library from sources by any method you prefer
(see `Installation Guide <https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/blob/master/docs/Installation-Guide.rst>`__).
For example, you can use ``MSBuild`` tool and `solution file <https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/blob/master/windows/LightGBM.sln>`__ from the repo.

.. code:: sh

  MSBuild.exe windows/LightGBM.sln /p:Configuration=DLL /p:Platform=x64 /p:PlatformToolset=v143

After compiling dynamic library just run ``sh ./build-python.sh install --precompile`` to install the Python-package using that library.

|

Build Wheel File
****************

You can run ``sh ./build-python.sh bdist_wheel`` to build a wheel file but not install it.

That script requires some dependencies like ``build``, ``scikit-build-core``, and ``wheel``.
In environments with restricted or no internet access, install those tools and then pass ``--no-isolation``.

.. code:: sh

  sh ./build-python.sh bdist_wheel --no-isolation
