# [description]
#
#   Look for the last run of a given GitHub Actions workflow on a given branch.
#   If there's never been one (as might be the case with optional workflows like valgrind),
#   exit with 0.
#
#   Otherwise, check the status of that latest run.
#   If it wasn't successful, exit with a non-0 exit code.
#
# [usage]
#
#     check-workflow-status.sh <BRANCH> <WORKFLOW_FILE>
#
# BRANCH: name of a branch involved in a pull request.
#
# WORKFLOW_FILE: filename (e.g. 'r_valgrind.yml') defining the GitHub Actions workflow.
