# Efficient training means training without giving up too much RAM
# In the case of many trainings (like 100+ models), RAM will be eaten very quickly
# Therefore, it is essential to know a strategy to deal with such issue

# Quote: "@Laurae2 Thanks for nice easily reproducible example (unlike mine).
# With reset=FALSE you get after 500 iterations (not 1000): OS reports 27GB usage, while R gc() reports 1.5GB.
# Just doing reset=TRUE will already improve things: OS reports 4.6GB.
# Doing reset=TRUE and calling gc() in the loop will have OS 1.3GB. Thanks for the latest tip."
