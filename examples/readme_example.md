Overview
The main objective of this project is to implement and test a LightGBM model that leverages a custom loss function to enhance its performance in predicting binary outcomes. The dataset used for testing is the Breast Cancer dataset from the scikit-learn library.

Key Features
Custom logistic loss function for training
Unit tests to validate model training and classification performance
Evaluation metrics: precision, recall, F1-score
Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

Python 3.x
LightGBM
NumPy
scikit-learn
unittest (part of Python's standard library)
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install lightgbm numpy scikit-learn
Usage
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Run the tests:

bash
Copy code
python -m unittest classification_example_test.py
This command will execute the unit tests defined in classification_example_test.py.

Testing
The test suite includes the following methods:

test_model_training:

Validates that the model can be trained without errors and that the output predictions are probabilities (between 0 and 1).
test_classification_performance:

Checks that the classification performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) exceed the specified thresholds (0.8).
