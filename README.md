LightGBM, Light Gradient Boosting Machine
==========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/LightGBM.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/LightGBM)

LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that is using tree based learning algorithms. It is designed to be distributed and efficient with following advantages:

- Fast training speed and high efficiency
- Lower memory usage
- Better accuracy
- Parallel learning supported
- Capacity of handling large scale data

For more details, please refer to [Features](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/wiki/Features).

The [experiments](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/wiki/Experiments#comparison-experiment) on public dataset show that LightGBM outperform other existing boosting tools on both efficiency and accuracy, with significant lower memory consumption. What's more, the [experiments](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/wiki/Experiments#parallel-experiment) show that LightGBM can achieve linear speed-up by using multiple machines for training in specific settings.
