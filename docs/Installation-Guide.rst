Installation Guide
==================

All instructions below are aimed at compiling the 64-bit version of LightGBM.
It is worth compiling the 32-bit version only in very rare special cases involving environmental limitations.
The 32-bit version is slow and untested, so use it at your own risk and don't forget to adjust some of the commands below when installing.

By default, instructions below will use **VS Build Tools** or **make** tool to compile the code.
It it possible to use `Ninja`_ tool instead of make on all platforms, but VS Build Tools cannot be replaced with Ninja.
You can add ``-G Ninja`` to CMake flags to use Ninja.

By default, instructions below will produce a shared library file and an executable file with command-line interface.
You can add ``-DBUILD_CLI=OFF`` to CMake flags to disable the executable compilation.

If you need to build a static library instead of a shared one, you can add ``-DBUILD_STATIC_LIB=ON`` to CMake flags.

By default, instructions below will place header files into system-wide folder.
You can add ``-DINSTALL_HEADERS=OFF`` to CMake flags to disable headers installation.

By default, on macOS, CMake is looking into Homebrew standard folders for finding dependencies (e.g. OpenMP).
You can add ``-DUSE_HOMEBREW_FALLBACK=OFF`` to CMake flags to disable this behaviour.

Users who want to perform benchmarking can make LightGBM output time costs for different internal routines by adding ``-DUSE_TIMETAG=ON`` to CMake flags.

It is possible to build LightGBM in debug mode.
In this mode all compiler optimizations are disabled and LightGBM performs more checks internally.
To enable debug mode you can add ``-DUSE_DEBUG=ON`` to CMake flags or choose ``Debug_*`` configuration (e.g. ``Debug_DLL``, ``Debug_mpi``) in Visual Studio depending on how you are building LightGBM.

.. _sanitizers:

In addition to the debug mode, LightGBM can be built with compiler sanitizers.
To enable them add ``-DUSE_SANITIZER=ON -DENABLED_SANITIZERS="address;leak;undefined"`` to CMake flags.
These values refer to the following supported sanitizers:

- ``address`` - AddressSanitizer (ASan);
- ``leak`` - LeakSanitizer (LSan);
- ``undefined`` - UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSan);
- ``thread`` - ThreadSanitizer (TSan).

Please note, that ThreadSanitizer cannot be used together with other sanitizers.
For more info and additional sanitizers' parameters please refer to the `following docs`_.
It is very useful to build `C++ unit tests <#build-c-unit-tests>`__ with sanitizers.

.. _nightly-builds:

You can download the artifacts of the latest successful build on master branch (nightly builds) here: |download artifacts|.

^^^^^^^

On Windows, a GPU version of LightGBM (``device_type=gpu``) can be built using

- **OpenCL**, **Boost**, **CMake** and **VS Build Tools**;
- **OpenCL**, **Boost**, **CMake** and **MinGW**.

If you use **MinGW**, the build procedure is similar to the build on Linux.

Following procedure is for the **MSVC** (Microsoft Visual C++) build.

1. Install `Git for Windows`_, `CMake`_ and `VS Build Tools`_ (**VS Build Tools** is not needed if **Visual Studio** is installed).

2. Install **OpenCL** for Windows. The installation depends on the brand (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel) of your GPU card.

   - For running on Intel, get `Intel SDK for OpenCL`_.

   - For running on AMD, get AMD APP SDK.

   - For running on NVIDIA, get `CUDA Toolkit`_.

   Further reading and correspondence table: `GPU SDK Correspondence and Device Targeting Table <./GPU-Targets.rst>`__.

3. Install `Boost Binaries`_.

   **Note**: Match your Visual C++ version:

   Visual Studio 2015 -> ``msvc-14.0-64.exe``,

   Visual Studio 2017 -> ``msvc-14.1-64.exe``,

   Visual Studio 2019 -> ``msvc-14.2-64.exe``,

   Visual Studio 2022 -> ``msvc-14.3-64.exe``.

4. Run the following commands:

   .. code:: console

     git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM
     cd LightGBM
     cmake -B build -S . -A x64 -DUSE_GPU=ON -DBOOST_ROOT=C:/local/boost_1_63_0 -DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR=C:/local/boost_1_63_0/lib64-msvc-14.0
     # if you have installed NVIDIA CUDA to a customized location, you should specify paths to OpenCL headers and library like the following:
     # cmake -B build -S . -A x64 -DUSE_GPU=ON -DBOOST_ROOT=C:/local/boost_1_63_0 -DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR=C:/local/boost_1_63_0/lib64-msvc-14.0 -DOpenCL_LIBRARY="C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v10.0/lib/x64/OpenCL.lib" -DOpenCL_INCLUDE_DIR="C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v10.0/include"
     cmake --build build --target ALL_BUILD --config Release

   **Note**: ``C:/local/boost_1_63_0`` and ``C:/local/boost_1_63_0/lib64-msvc-14.0`` are locations of your **Boost** binaries (assuming you've downloaded 1.63.0 version for Visual Studio 2015).

2. Install `SWIG`_ and **Java** (also make sure that ``JAVA_HOME`` environment variable is set properly).

3. Run the following commands:

   .. code:: console

     git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM
     cd LightGBM
     cmake -B build -S . -A x64 -DUSE_SWIG=ON

     export CXX=clang++-14 CC=clang-14  # replace "14" with version of Clang installed on your machine
     cmake -B build -S . -DUSE_SWIG=ON
     cmake --build build -j4

macOS
^^^^^

On macOS, a Java wrapper of LightGBM can be built using

- **CMake**, **Java**, **SWIG** and **Apple Clang**;
- **CMake**, **Java**, **SWIG** and **gcc**.

Apple Clang
***********

1. Install `CMake`_, **Java** (also make sure that ``JAVA_HOME`` environment variable is set properly), `SWIG`_ and **OpenMP**:

   .. code:: sh

     brew install cmake openjdk swig libomp
     export JAVA_HOME="$(brew --prefix openjdk)/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home/"

2. Run the following commands:

   .. code:: sh

     git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM
     cd LightGBM
     cmake -B build -S . -DUSE_SWIG=ON
     cmake --build build -j4

gcc
***

1. Install `CMake`_, **Java** (also make sure that ``JAVA_HOME`` environment variable is set properly), `SWIG`_ and **gcc**:

   .. code:: sh

     brew install cmake openjdk swig gcc
     export JAVA_HOME="$(brew --prefix openjdk)/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home/"

2. Run the following commands:

   .. code:: sh

     git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM
     cd LightGBM
     export CXX=g++-7 CC=gcc-7  # replace "7" with version of gcc installed on your machine
     cmake -B build -S . -DUSE_SWIG=ON
     cmake --build build -j4

Build Python-package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to `Python-package folder <https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/tree/master/python-package>`__.

Build R-package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to `R-package folder <https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/tree/master/R-package>`__.

Build C++ Unit Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows
^^^^^^^

On Windows, C++ unit tests of LightGBM can be built using

- **CMake** and **VS Build Tools**;
- **CMake** and **MinGW**.

VS Build Tools
**************

1. Install `Git for Windows`_, `CMake`_ and `VS Build Tools`_ (**VS Build Tools** is not needed if **Visual Studio** is already installed).

2. Run the following commands:

   .. code:: console

     git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM
     cd LightGBM
     cmake -B build -S . -A x64 -DBUILD_CPP_TEST=ON
     cmake --build build --target testlightgbm --config Debug

The ``.exe`` file will be in ``LightGBM/Debug`` folder.

MinGW-w64
*********

1. Install `Git for Windows`_, `CMake`_ and `MinGW-w64`_.

2. Run the following commands:

   .. code:: console

     git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM
     cd LightGBM
     cmake -B build -S . -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DBUILD_CPP_TEST=ON
     cmake --build build --target testlightgbm -j4

The ``.exe`` file will be in ``LightGBM/`` folder.

**Note**: You may need to run the ``cmake -B build -S . -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DBUILD_CPP_TEST=ON`` one more time or add ``-DCMAKE_SH=CMAKE_SH-NOTFOUND`` to CMake flags if you encounter the ``sh.exe was found in your PATH`` error.

Linux
^^^^^

On Linux, a C++ unit tests of LightGBM can be built using

- **CMake** and **gcc**;
- **CMake** and **Clang**.

After compilation the executable file will be in ``LightGBM/`` folder.

gcc
***

1. Install `CMake`_ and **gcc**.

2. Run the following commands:

   .. code:: sh

     git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM
     cd LightGBM
     cmake -B build -S . -DBUILD_CPP_TEST=ON
     cmake --build build --target testlightgbm -j4

Clang
*****

1. Install `CMake`_, **Clang** and **OpenMP**.

2. Run the following commands:

   .. code:: sh

     git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM
     cd LightGBM
     export CXX=clang++-14 CC=clang-14  # replace "14" with version of Clang installed on your machine
     cmake -B build -S . -DBUILD_CPP_TEST=ON
     cmake --build build --target testlightgbm -j4
