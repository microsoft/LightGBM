# [description]
#
#   Core dependencies used across most LightGBM continuous integration (CI) jobs.
#
#   'python' constraint is intentionally omitted, so this file can be reused across
#   Python versions.
#
#   These floors are not the oldest versions LightGBM supports... they're here just to make conda
#   solves faster, and should generally be the latest versions that work for all CI jobs using this.
#
# [usage]
#
#   conda create \
#     --name test-env \
#     --file ./.ci/conda-envs/ci-core.txt \
#     python=3.10
