# CRAN Submission History

## v4.3.0 - Submission 1 - (January 18, 2024)

### CRAN response

Accepted to CRAN

### Maintainer Notes

This submission was put up in response to CRAN saying the package would be archived if the following
warning was not fixed within 14 days.

```text
/usr/local/clang-trunk/bin/../include/c++/v1/__fwd/string_view.h:22:41:
warning: 'char_traits<fmt::detail::char8_type>' is deprecated:
char_traits<T> for T not equal to char, wchar_t, char8_t, char16_t or char32_t is non-standard and is provided for a temporary period.
It will be removed in LLVM 19, so please migrate off of it. [-Wdeprecated-declarations]
```

See https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/issues/6264.

## v4.2.0 - Submission 1 - (December 7, 2023)

### CRAN response

Accepted to CRAN

### Maintainer Notes

This submission included many changes from the last 2 years, as well as fixes for a warning
CRAN said could cause the package to be archived: https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/issues/6221.

## v4.1.0 - not submitted

v4.1.0 was not submitted to CRAN, because https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/issues/5987 had not been resolved.

## v4.0.0 - Submission 2 - (July 19, 2023)

### CRAN response

> Dear maintainer,
> package lightgbm_4.0.0.tar.gz does not pass the incoming checks automatically.

The logs linked from those messagges showed one issue remaining on Debian (0 on Windows).

```text
* checking examples ... [7s/4s] NOTE

```

### Maintainer Notes

Chose to document the issue and need for a fix in https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/issues/5987, but not resubmit,
to avoid annoying CRAN maintainers.

## v4.0.0 - Submission 1 - (July 16, 2023)

### CRAN response

> Dear maintainer,
> package lightgbm_4.0.0.tar.gz does not pass the incoming checks automatically.

The logs linked from those messages showed the following issues from `R CMD check`.

### Maintainer Notes

Attempted to fix these with https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/5988 and resubmitted.

## v3.3.5 - Submission 2 - (January 16, 2023)

### CRAN response

> Reason was

> Flavor: r-devel-windows-x86_64
> Check: OOverall checktime, Result: NOTE
>  Overall checktime 14 min > 10 min

### Maintainer Notes

This was technically not a "resubmission".
We asked CRAN why the first v3.3.5 submission had been archived, and they responded with the response above... and then v3.3.5 passed all checks with no further work from LightGBM maintainers.

your packages need to be updated for R-devel/R 4.2 to work on Windows,
following the recent switch to UCRT and Rtools42.

Sorry for the group message, please feel free to respond individually
regarding your package or ask specifically about what needs to be fixed.

I've created patches for you, so please review them and fix your packages:

https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsvn.r-project.org%2FR-dev-web%2Ftrunk%2FWindowsBuilds%2Fwinutf8%2Fucrt3%2Fr_packages%2Fpatches%2FCRAN%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cyushi2%40microsoft.com%7C8e6c353d1a8842c81eeb08d9bef5d835%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637750786169848244%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=rFGf7Y4Dvo6g1kzV%2BeAJDLGm1TUtzQsLsavElTw6H1U%3D&amp;reserved=0

patch --binary < package.diff

These patches are currently automatically applied by R-devel on Windows
at installation time, which makes most of your packages pass their
checks (as OK or NOTE), but please check your results carefully and
carefully review the patches. Usually these changes were because of
newer GCC or newer MinGW in the toolchain, but some for other reasons,
and some of them will definitely have to be improved so that the package
keeps building also for older versions of R using Rtools40. We have only
been testing the patches with UCRT (and Rtools42) on Windows.

For more information, please see

https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.r-project.org%2FBlog%2Fpublic%2F2021%2F12%2F07%2Fupcoming-changes-in-r-4.2-on-windows%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cyushi2%40microsoft.com%7C8e6c353d1a8842c81eeb08d9bef5d835%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637750786169848244%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=SY77zgtbDbHvTxTgPLOoe%2Fw5OZDhXvJoxpVOoEaKoYo%3D&amp;reserved=0

Once you add your patches/fix the issues, your package will probably
show a warning during R CMD check (as patching would be attempted to be
applied again). That's ok, at that point please let me know and I will
remove my patch from the repository of automatically applied patches.

If you end up just applying the patch as is, there is probably no need
testing on your end, but you can do so using Winbuilder, r-hub, github
actions (e.g. https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fkalibera%2Fucrt3&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cyushi2%40microsoft.com%7C8e6c353d1a8842c81eeb08d9bef5d835%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637750786169848244%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=msqoPzqDStlAUn%2Bb6gGevwFPD%2FaNL5dTxiNud2Sqzy8%3D&amp;reserved=0).

If you wanted to test locally on your Windows machine and do not have a
UCRT version of R-devel yet, please uninstall your old version of
R-devel, delete the old library used with that, install a new UCRT
version of R-devel , and install Rtools42. You can keep Rtools40
installed if you need it with R 4.1 or earlier.

Currently, the new R-devel can be downloaded from
https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.r-project.org%2Fnosvn%2Fwinutf8%2Fucrt3%2Fweb%2Frdevel.html&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cyushi2%40microsoft.com%7C8e6c353d1a8842c81eeb08d9bef5d835%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637750786169848244%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=0hCwONzLmcW0GIXNqiOZQEIuhNA%2BjHhQvXsofs8J98o%3D&amp;reserved=0

And Rtools42 from
https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.r-project.org%2Fnosvn%2Fwinutf8%2Fucrt3%2Fweb%2Frtools.html&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cyushi2%40microsoft.com%7C8e6c353d1a8842c81eeb08d9bef5d835%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637750786169848244%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=WLWLbOyQKbaYz8gkfKz2sqoGknjIOtl1aGAhUF%2Bpylg%3D&amp;reserved=0

If you end up testing locally, you can use R_INSTALL_TIME_PATCHES
environment variable to disable the automated patching, see the "howto"
document above. That way you could also see what the original issue was
causing.

If you wanted to find libraries to link for yourself, e.g. in a newer
version of your package, please look for "Using findLinkingOrder with
Rtools42 (tiff package example)" in the "howto" document above. I
created the patches for you manually before we finished this script, so
you may be able to create a shorter version using it, but - it's
probably not worth the effort.

If you wanted to try in a virtual machine, but did not have a license,
you can use also an automated setup of a free trial VM from
https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.r-project.org%2FBlog%2Fpublic%2F2021%2F03%2F18%2Fvirtual-windows-machine-for-checking-r-packages&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cyushi2%40microsoft.com%7C8e6c353d1a8842c81eeb08d9bef5d835%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637750786169848244%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=aFFQYuC9CoBwBiLgZHi8N3yUnSiHu5Xtdqb2YBiMIHQ%3D&amp;reserved=0

(but that needs a very good and un-metered network connection to install)

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tomas & Uwe

## v3.3.1 - Submission 1 - (October 27, 2021)

### CRAN response

Accepted to CRAN on October 30, 2021.

CRAN completed its checks and preparation of binaries on November 6, 2021.

### Maintainer Notes

Submitted v3.3.1 to CRAN, with the following fixes for the issues that caused CRAN to reject v3.3.0 and archive the package:

* https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/4673
* https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/4714

Submitted with the following comment:

> This submission contains {lightgbm} 3.3.1.
> Per CRAN's policies, I am submitting on it on behalf of the project's maintainer (Yu Shi), with his permission (https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/4715#issuecomment-952537783).

> {lightgbm} was removed from CRAN on October 25, 2021 due to issues detected in the gcc-ASAN and clang-ASAN checks. To the best of our knowledge, we believe this release fixes those issues. We have introduced automated testing that we believe faithfully reproduces CRAN's tests with sanitizers (https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/4678).

> Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Progress on the submission was tracked in https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/issues/4713.

## v3.3.0 - Submission 1 - (October 8, 2021)

### CRAN response

`{lightgbm}` was removed from CRAN entirely on October 25, 2021.

On October 12, 2021, maintainers received the following message from CRAN (ripley@stats.ox.ac.uk):

> Dear maintainer,

> Please see the problems shown on https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_lightgbm.html

> Please correct before 2021-10-25 to safely retain your package on CRAN.

> Do remember to look at the 'Additional issues'.

> The CRAN Team

We failed to produce a new submission prior to that date, so the package was removed entirely.

See https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/issues/4713 for additional background and links explaining the specific failed CRAN checks.

### Maintainer Notes

In this submission, we attempted to switch the maintainer of the package (in the CRAN official sense) from Guolin Ke to Yu Shi.
Did this by adding a note in the CRAN submission web form explaining Guolin's departure from Microsoft.

## v3.2.1 - Submission 1 - (April 12, 2021)

### CRAN response

Accepted to CRAN.

### Maintainer Notes

## v3.2.0 - Submission 1 - (March 22, 2021)

### CRAN response

Package is failing checks in the `r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-clang` environment (described [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_flavors.html#r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-clang)). Specifically, one unit test on the use of non-ASCII feature names in `Booster$dump_model()` fails.

> Apparently your package fails its checks in a strict Latin-1* locale,
e.g. under Linux using LANG=en_US.iso88591 (see the debian-clang
results).

> Please correct before 2021-04-21 to safely retain your package on CRAN.

### Maintainer Notes

Submitted a version 3.2.1 to correct the errors noted.

## v3.1.1 - Submission 1 - (December 7, 2020)

### CRAN response

Accepted to CRAN, December 8.

### Maintainer Notes

Submitted a fix to 3.1.0 that skips some learning-to-rank tests on 32-bit Windows.

## v3.1.0 - Submission 1 - (November 15, 2020)

### CRAN response

Accepted to CRAN, November 18.

On November 21, found out that the CRAN's `r-oldrel-windows-ix86+x86_64` check was failing, with an issue similar to the one faced on Solaris and fixed in https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/3534.

CRAN did not ask for a re-submission, but this was fixed in 3.1.1.

### Maintainer Notes

This package was submitted with the following information in the "optional comments" box.

```text
Hello,

I'm submitting {lightgbm} 3.1.0 on behalf of the maintainer, Guolin Ke. I am a co-author on the package, and he has asked me to handle this submission. We saw in https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html#Submission that this is permitted.

{lightgbm} was removed from CRAN in October for issues found by valgrind checks. We have invested significant effort in addressing those issues and creating an automatic test that tries to replicate CRAN's valgrind checks: https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/blob/742d72f8bb051105484fd5cca11620493ffb0b2b/.github/workflows/r_valgrind.yml.

We see two warnings from valgrind that we believe are not problematic.

==2063==    by 0x498E414: R_execClosure (eval.c:1895)

We believe this is a false positive, and related to a misunderstanding between valgrind and openmp (https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=36298).

We have also added automated tests with ASAN/UBSAN to our testing setup, and have checked the package on Solaris 10 and found no issues.

## v3.0.0.2 - Submission 1 - (September 29, 2020)

### CRAN response

First response was a message talking about failing checks on 3.0.0.

```text
package lightgbm_3.0.0.2.tar.gz has been auto-processed.
The auto-check found additional issues for the last version released on CRAN:
gcc-UBSAN <link>
valgrind <link>
CRAN incoming checks do not test for these additional issues and you will need an appropriately instrumented build of R to reproduce these.
Hence please reply-all and explain: Have these been fixed?

Please correct before 2020-10-05 to safely retain your package on CRAN.

There is still a valgrind error. This did not happen when tested on
submission, but the tests did run until timeout at 4 hours. When you
write illegally, corruption is common.

Illegal writes are serious errors.
```

Then in later responses to email correspondence with CRAN, CRAN expressed frustration with the number of failed submission and banned this package from new submissions for a month.

The content of that frustrated message was regrettable and it does not need to be preserved forever in this file.

### Maintainer Notes

The 3.0.0.x series is officially not making it to CRAN. We will wait until November, and try again.

Detailed plan about what will be tried before November 2020 to increase the likelihood of success for that package: https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/3338#issuecomment-702756840.

## v3.0.0.1 - Submission 1 - (September 24, 2020)

### CRAN response

```text
Thanks, we see:

Still lots of alignment errors, such as

lightgbm.Rcheck/tests/testthat.Rout:io/dataset_loader.cpp:340:59:
runtime error: reference binding to misaligned address 0x7f51fefad81e for type 'const value_type', which requires 4 byte alignment
lightgbm.Rcheck/tests/testthat.Rout:/usr/include/c++/10/bits/stl_vector.h:1198:21:
runtime error: reference binding to misaligned address 0x7f51fefad81e for type 'const int', which requires 4 byte alignment lightgbm.Rcheck/tests/testthat.Rout:/usr/include/c++/10/bits/vector.tcc:449:28:runtime

runtime error: reference binding to misaligned address 0x7f51fefad81e for type 'const type', which requires 4 byte alignment

Please fix and resubmit.
```

### Maintainer Notes

Ok, these are the notes from the UBSAN tests. Was able to reproduce them with https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/3338#issuecomment-700399862, and they were fixed in https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/3415.

Struggling to replicate the valgrind result (running `R CMD check --use-valgrind` returns no issues), so trying submission again. Hoping that the fixes for mis-alignment fix the other errors too.

## v3.0.0 - Submission 6 - (September 24, 2020)

### CRAN response

Failing pre-checks.

### `R CMD check` results

```text
* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... WARNING
Maintainer: ‘Guolin Ke <guolin.ke@microsoft.com>’

Insufficient package version (submitted: 3.0.0, existing: 3.0.0)

Days since last update: 4
```

### Maintainer Notes

Did not think the version needed to be incremented if submitting a package in response to CRAN saying "you are failing checks and will be kicked off if you don't fix it", but I guess you do!

This can be fixed by just re-submitting but with the version changed from `3.0.0` to `3.0.0.1`.

## v3.0.0 - Submission 5 - (September 11, 2020)

### CRAN Response

### Maintainer Notes

Added a patch that `psutil` has used to fix missing `ifaddrs.h` on Solaris 10: https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/issues/629#issuecomment-665091451.

## v3.0.0 - Submission 4 - (September 4, 2020)

### CRAN Response

> Thanks, if the running time is the only reason to wrap the examples in
\donttest, please replace \donttest by \donttest (\donttest examples are
not executed in the CRAN checks).

> Please replace cat() by message() or warning() in your functions (except
for print() and summary() functions). Messages and warnings can be
suppressed if needed.

> Missing Rd-tags:
  lightgbm/man/dimnames.lgb.Dataset.Rd: \value
  lightgbm/man/lgb.Dataset.construct.Rd: \value
  lightgbm/man/lgb.prepare.Rd: \value
  ...

> Please add the tag and explain in detail the returned objects.

### Maintainer Notes

Responded to CRAN with the following:

All examples have been wrapped with `\donttest` as requested. We have replied to Swetlana Herbrandt asking for clarification on the donttest news item in the R 4.0.2 changelog (https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/NEWS.html).

All uses of `cat()` have been replaced with `print()`. We chose `print()` over `message()` because it's important that they be written to stdout alongside all the other logs coming from the library's C++ code. `message()` and `warning()` write to stderr.

All exported objects now have `\value{}` statements in their documentation files in `man/`.

**We also replied directly to CRAN's feedback email**

> Swetlana,

> Thank you for your comments. I've just created a new submission that I believe addresses them.

> Can you help us understand something? In your message you said "\donttest examples are
not executed in the CRAN checks)", but in https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/NEWS.html  we see the following:

> > "`R CMD check --as-cran` now runs \donttest examples (which are run by example()) instead of instructing the tester to do so. This can be temporarily circumvented during development by setting environment variable `_R_CHECK_DONTTEST_EXAMPLES_` to a false value."

> Could you help us understand how both of those statements can be true?

## v3.0.0 - Submission 3 - (August 29, 2020)

### CRAN response

* Please write references in the description of the DESCRIPTION file in
the form
  - authors (year) doi:...
  - authors (year) arXiv:...
  - authors (year, ISBN:...)
* if those are not available: authors (year) https:... with no space after 'doi:', 'arXiv:', 'https:' and angle brackets for auto-linking.
* (If you want to add a title as well please put it in quotes: "Title")

* \donttest{} should only be used if the example really cannot be executed (e.g. because of missing additional software, missing API keys, ...) by the user. That's why wrapping examples in \donttest{} adds the comment ("# Not run:") as a warning for the user. Does not seem necessary. Please unwrap the examples if they are executable in < 5 sec, or replace
\donttest{} with \donttest{}.

* Please do not modify the global environment (e.g. by using <<-) in your
functions. This is not allowed by the CRAN policies.

* Please always add all authors, contributors and copyright holders in the Authors@R field with the appropriate roles. From CRAN policies you agreed to: "The ownership of copyright and intellectual property rights of all components of the package must be clear and unambiguous (including from the authors specification in the DESCRIPTION file). Where code is copied (or derived) from the work of others (including from R itself), care must be taken that any copyright/license statements are preserved and authorship is not misrepresented." e.g.: Microsoft Corporation, Dropbox Inc. Please explain in the submission comments what you did about this issue.

Please fix and resubmit

### Maintainer Notes

Responded to CRAN with the following:

The paper citation has been adjusted as requested. We were using 'glmnet' as a  guide on how to include the URL but maybe they are no longer in compliance with CRAN policies: https://github.com/cran/glmnet/blob/b1a4b50de01e0cd24343959d7cf86452bac17b26/DESCRIPTION

All authors from the original LightGBM paper have been added to Authors@R as `"aut"`. We have also added Microsoft and DropBox, Inc. as `"cph"` (copyright holders). These roles were chosen based on the guidance in https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2012-1/RJournal_2012-1_Hornik~et~al.pdf.

lightgbm's code does use `<<-`, but it does not modify the global environment. The uses of `<<-` in R/lgb.interprete.R and R/callback.R are in functions which are called in an environment created by the lightgbm functions that call them, and this operator is used to reach one level up into the calling function's environment.

We chose to wrap our examples in `\donttest{}` because we found, through testing on https://builder.r-hub.io/ and in our own continuous integration environments, that their run time varies a lot between platforms, and we cannot guarantee that all examples will run in under 5 seconds. We intentionally chose `\donttest{}` over `\donttest{}` because this item in the R 4.0.0 changelog (https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/NEWS.html) seems to indicate that \donttest will be ignored by CRAN's automated checks:

> "`R CMD check --as-cran` now runs \donttest examples (which are run by example()) instead of instructing the tester to do so. This can be temporarily circumvented during development by setting environment variable `_R_CHECK_DONTTEST_EXAMPLES_` to a false value."

We run all examples with `R CMD check --as-cran --run-dontrun` in our continuous integration tests on every commit to the package, so we have high confidence that they are working correctly.

### Maintainer Notes

We should tell them the misspellings note is a false positive.

For the note about included files, that is my fault. I had extra files laying around when I generated the package. I'm surprised to see `docs/` in that list, since it is ignored in  `.Rbuildignore`. I even tested that with [the exact code Rbuildignore uses](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/9d13622f41cfa0f36db2595bd6a5bf93e2010e21/src/library/tools/R/build.R#L85). For now, I added `rm -r  docs/` to `build-cran-package.sh`. We can figure out what is happening with `.Rbuildignore` in the future, but it shouldn't block a release.

## v3.0.0 - Submission 1 - (August 24, 2020)

NOTE: 3.0.0-1 was never released to CRAN. CRAN was on vacation August 14-24, 2020, and in that time version 3.0.0-1 (a release candidate) became 3.0.0.

### Maintainer Notes

The "checking CRAN incoming feasibility" NOTE can be safely ignored. It only shows up the first time you submit a package to CRAN.

So the only thing I see broken right now is the test error on 32-bit Windows. This is documented in https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/issues/3187.

### Maintainer Notes

Seems removing `Biarch` field didn't work. Noticed this in the install logs:

> Warning: this package has a non-empty 'configure.win' file, so building only the main architecture

Tried adding `Biarch: true` to `DESCRIPTION` to overcome this.

NOTE about non-standard files was the result of a mistake in `.Rbuildignore` syntax, and something strange with how `cran-comments.md` line in `.Rbuildignore`  was treated. Updated `.Rbuildignore` and added an `rm cran-comments.md` to `build-cran-package.sh`.

## v3.0.0-1 - Submission 1 - (August 9, 2020)

### CRAN response

### Maintainer Notes

Thought the issue on Windows was caused by `Biarch: false` in `DESCRIPTION`. Removed `Biarch` field.

Thought the "misspellings" issue could be resolved by adding single quotes around LightGBM, like `'LightGBM'`.
