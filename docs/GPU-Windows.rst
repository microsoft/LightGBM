GPU Windows Compilation
=======================

This guide is for the MinGW build.

For the MSVC (Visual Studio) build with GPU, please refer to `Installation Guide <./Installation-Guide.rst#build-gpu-version>`__.
(We recommend you to use this since it is much easier).

Install LightGBM GPU version in Windows (CLI / R / Python), using MinGW/gcc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is for a vanilla installation of Boost, including full compilation steps from source without precompiled libraries.

Installation steps (depends on what you are going to do):

-  Install the appropriate OpenCL SDK

-  Install MinGW

-  Install Boost

-  Install Git

-  Install CMake

-  Create LightGBM binaries

-  Debugging LightGBM in CLI (if GPU is crashing or any other crash reason)

If you wish to use another compiler like Visual Studio C++ compiler, you need to adapt the steps to your needs.

For this compilation tutorial, we are using AMD SDK for our OpenCL steps.
However, you are free to use any OpenCL SDK you want, you just need to adjust the PATH correctly.

You will also need administrator rights. This will not work without them.

At the end, you can restore your original PATH.

--------------

Modifying PATH (for newbies)
----------------------------

To modify PATH, just follow the pictures after going to the ``Control Panel``:

.. image:: ./_static/images/screenshot-system.png
   :align: center
   :target: ./_static/images/screenshot-system.png
   :alt: A screenshot of the System option under System and Security of the Control Panel.

Then, go to ``Advanced`` > ``Environment Variables...``:

.. image:: ./_static/images/screenshot-advanced-system-settings.png
   :align: center
   :target: ./_static/images/screenshot-advanced-system-settings.png
   :alt: A screenshot of the System Properties window.

Under ``System variables``, the variable ``Path``:

.. image:: ./_static/images/screenshot-environment-variables.png
   :align: center
   :target: ./_static/images/screenshot-environment-variables.png
   :alt: A screenshot of the Environment variables window with variable path selected under the system variables.

--------------

Antivirus Performance Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Does not apply to you if you do not use a third-party antivirus nor the default preinstalled antivirus on Windows.

**Windows Defender or any other antivirus will have a significant impact on the speed you will be able to perform the steps.**
It is recommended to **turn them off temporarily** until you finished with building and setting up everything, then turn them back on, if you are using them.

--------------

OpenCL SDK Installation
-----------------------

Installing the appropriate OpenCL SDK requires you to download the correct vendor source SDK.
You need to know what you are going to use LightGBM!

-  For running on Intel, get `Intel SDK for OpenCL`_ (**NOT RECOMMENDED**).

-  For running on AMD, get AMD APP SDK (downloads `for Linux`_ and `for Windows`_). You may want to replace the ``OpenCL.dll`` from the GPU driver package with the one from the SDK, if the one shipped with the driver lacks some functions.

-  For running on NVIDIA, get `CUDA Toolkit`_.

-  Or you can try to use `Khronos official OpenCL headers`_, the CMake module would automatically find the OpenCL library used in your system, though the result may be not portable.

Further reading and correspondence table (especially if you intend to use cross-platform devices,
like Intel CPU with AMD APP SDK): `GPU SDK Correspondence and Device Targeting Table <./GPU-Targets.rst>`__.

**Warning**: using Intel OpenCL is not recommended and may crash your machine due to being non compliant to OpenCL standards.
If your objective is to use LightGBM + OpenCL on CPU, please use AMD APP SDK instead (it can run also on Intel CPUs without any issues).

--------------

MinGW Correct Compiler Selection
--------------------------------

If you are expecting to use LightGBM without R, you need to install MinGW.
Installing MinGW is straightforward, download `this`_.

Make sure you are using the x86\_64 architecture, and do not modify anything else.
You may choose a version other than the most recent one if you need a previous MinGW version.

.. image:: ./_static/images/screenshot-mingw-installation.png
   :align: center
   :target: ./_static/images/screenshot-mingw-installation.png
   :alt: A screenshot of the Min G W installation setup settings window.

Then, add to your PATH the following (to adjust to your MinGW version):

.. code:: text

    C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-5.3.0-posix-seh-rt_v4-rev0\mingw64\bin

**Warning**: R users (even if you do not want LightGBM for R)

If you have RTools and MinGW installed, and wish to use LightGBM in R,
get rid of MinGW from PATH (to keep: ``c:\Rtools\bin;c:\Rtools\mingw_32\bin`` for 32-bit R installation,
``c:\Rtools\bin;c:\Rtools\mingw_64\bin`` for 64-bit R installation).

You can check which MinGW version you are using by running the following in a command prompt: ``gcc -v``:

.. image:: ./_static/images/screenshot-r-mingw-used.png
   :align: center
   :target: ./_static/images/screenshot-r-mingw-used.png
   :alt: A screenshot of the administrator command prompt where G C C version is being checked.

To check whether you need 32-bit or 64-bit MinGW for R, install LightGBM as usual and check for the following:

.. code:: r

    * installing *source* package 'lightgbm' ...
    ** libs
    c:/Rtools/mingw_64/bin/g++

If it says ``mingw_64`` then you need the 64-bit version (PATH with ``c:\Rtools\bin;c:\Rtools\mingw_64\bin``),
otherwise you need the 32-bit version (``c:\Rtools\bin;c:\Rtools\mingw_32\bin``), the latter being a very rare and untested case.

NOTE: If you are using `Rtools` 4.0 or later, the path will have `mingw64` instead of `mingw_64` (PATH with `C:\rtools40\mingw64\bin`), and `mingw32` instead of `mingw_32` (`C:\rtools40\mingw32\bin`). The 32-bit version remains an unsupported solution under Rtools 4.0.

Download the prebuilt Boost
---------------------------

Download  `Prebuilt Boost x86_64`_ or `Prebuilt Boost i686`_ and unpack them with `7zip`_, alternatively you can build Boost from source.

--------------

Boost Compilation
-----------------

Installing Boost requires to download Boost and to install it.
It takes about 10 minutes to several hours depending on your CPU speed and network speed.

We will assume an installation in ``C:\boost`` and a general installation (like in Unix variants: without versioning and without type tags).

There is one mandatory step to check the compiler:

-  **Warning**: if you want the R installation:
   If you have already MinGW in your PATH variable, get rid of it (you will link to the wrong compiler otherwise).

-  **Warning**: if you want the CLI installation:
   If you have already Rtools in your PATH variable, get rid of it (you will link to the wrong compiler otherwise).

-  R installation must have Rtools in PATH

-  CLI / Python installation must have MinGW (not Rtools) in PATH

In addition, assuming you are going to use ``C:\boost`` for the folder path,
you should add now already the following to PATH: ``C:\boost\boost-build\bin``, ``C:\boost\boost-build\include\boost``.
Adjust ``C:\boost`` if you install it elsewhere.

We can now start downloading and compiling the required Boost libraries:

-  Download `Boost`_ (for example, the filename for 1.63.0 version is ``boost_1_63_0.zip``)

-  Extract the archive to ``C:\boost``

-  Open a command prompt, and run

   .. code:: console

       cd C:\boost\boost_1_63_0\tools\build
       bootstrap.bat gcc
       b2 install --prefix="C:\boost\boost-build" toolset=gcc
       cd C:\boost\boost_1_63_0

To build the Boost libraries, you have two choices for command prompt:

-  If you have only one single core, you can use the default

   .. code:: console

       b2 install --build_dir="C:\boost\boost-build" --prefix="C:\boost\boost-build" toolset=gcc --with=filesystem,system threading=multi --layout=system release

-  If you want to do a multithreaded library building (faster), add ``-j N`` by replacing N by the number of cores/threads you have.
   For instance, for 2 cores, you would do

   .. code:: console

       b2 install --build_dir="C:\boost\boost-build" --prefix="C:\boost\boost-build" toolset=gcc --with=filesystem,system threading=multi --layout=system release -j 2

Ignore all the errors popping up, like Python, etc., they do not matter for us.

Your folder should look like this at the end (not fully detailed):

.. code:: text

    - C
      |--- boost
      |------ boost_1_63_0
      |--------- some folders and files
      |------ boost-build
      |--------- bin
      |--------- include
      |------------ boost
      |--------- lib
      |--------- share

This is what you should (approximately) get at the end of Boost compilation:

.. image:: ./_static/images/screenshot-boost-compiled.png
   :align: center
   :target: ./_static/images/screenshot-boost-compiled.png
   :alt: A screenshot of the command prompt that ends with text that reads - updated 14621 targets.

If you are getting an error:

-  Wipe your Boost directory

-  Close the command prompt

-  Make sure you added
   ``C:\boost\boost-build\bin``, ``C:\boost\boost-build\include\boost`` to
   your PATH (adjust accordingly if you use another folder)

-  Do the Boost compilation steps again (extract => command prompt => ``cd`` => ``bootstrap`` => ``b2`` => ``cd`` => ``b2``

--------------

Git Installation
----------------

Installing Git for Windows is straightforward, use the following `link`_.

.. image:: ./_static/images/screenshot-git-for-windows.png
   :align: center
   :target: ./_static/images/screenshot-git-for-windows.png
   :alt: A screenshot of the website to download git that shows various versions of git compatible with 32 bit and 64 bit Windows separately.

Now, we can fetch LightGBM repository for GitHub. Run Git Bash and the following command:

.. code:: console

    cd C:/
    mkdir github_repos
    cd github_repos
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM

Your LightGBM repository copy should now be under ``C:\github_repos\LightGBM``.
You are free to use any folder you want, but you have to adapt.

Keep Git Bash open.

--------------

CMake Installation, Configuration, Generation
---------------------------------------------

**CLI / Python users only**

Installing CMake requires one download first and then a lot of configuration for LightGBM:

.. image:: ./_static/images/screenshot-downloading-cmake.png
   :align: center
   :target: ./_static/images/screenshot-downloading-cmake.png
   :alt: A screenshot of the binary distributions of C Make for downloading on 64 bit Windows.

-  Download `CMake`_ (3.8 or higher)

-  Install CMake

-  Run cmake-gui

-  Select the folder where you put LightGBM for ``Where is the source code``,
   default using our steps would be ``C:/github_repos/LightGBM``

-  Copy the folder name, and add ``/build`` for "Where to build the binaries",
   default using our steps would be ``C:/github_repos/LightGBM/build``

-  Click ``Configure``

   .. image:: ./_static/images/screenshot-create-directory.png
      :align: center
      :target: ./_static/images/screenshot-create-directory.png
      :alt: A screenshot with a pop-up window that reads - Build directory does not exist, should I create it?

   .. image:: ./_static/images/screenshot-mingw-makefiles-to-use.png
      :align: center
      :target: ./_static/images/screenshot-mingw-makefiles-to-use.png
      :alt: A screenshot that asks to specify the generator for the project which should be selected as Min G W makefiles and selected as the use default native compilers option.

-  Lookup for ``USE_GPU`` and check the checkbox

   .. image:: ./_static/images/screenshot-use-gpu.png
      :align: center
      :target: ./_static/images/screenshot-use-gpu.png
      :alt: A screenshot of the C Make window where the checkbox with the test Use G P U is checked.

-  Click ``Configure``

   You should get (approximately) the following after clicking Configure:

   .. image:: ./_static/images/screenshot-configured-lightgbm.png
      :align: center
      :target: ./_static/images/screenshot-configured-lightgbm.png
      :alt: A screenshot of the C Make window after clicking on the configure button.

   .. code:: text

       Looking for CL_VERSION_2_0
       Looking for CL_VERSION_2_0 - found
       Found OpenCL: C:/Windows/System32/OpenCL.dll (found version "2.0")
       OpenCL include directory:C:/Program Files (x86)/AMD APP SDK/3.0/include
       Boost version: 1.63.0
       Found the following Boost libraries:
         filesystem
         system
       Configuring done

-  Click ``Generate`` to get the following message:

   .. code:: text

       Generating done

This is straightforward, as CMake is providing a large help into locating the correct elements.

--------------

LightGBM Compilation (CLI: final step)
--------------------------------------

Installation in CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**CLI / Python users**

Creating LightGBM libraries is very simple as all the important and hard steps were done before.

You can do everything in the Git Bash console you left open:

-  If you closed Git Bash console previously, run this to get back to the build folder:

   .. code:: console

       cd C:/github_repos/LightGBM/build

-  If you did not close the Git Bash console previously, run this to get to the build folder:

   .. code:: console

       cd LightGBM/build

-  Setup MinGW as ``make`` using

   .. code:: console

       alias make='mingw32-make'

   otherwise, beware error and name clash!

-  In Git Bash, run ``make`` and see LightGBM being installing!

.. image:: ./_static/images/screenshot-lightgbm-with-gpu-support-compiled.png
   :align: center
   :target: ./_static/images/screenshot-lightgbm-with-gpu-support-compiled.png
   :alt: A screenshot of the git bash window with Light G B M successfully installed.

If everything was done correctly, you now compiled CLI LightGBM with GPU support!

Testing in CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can now test LightGBM directly in CLI in a **command prompt** (not Git Bash):

.. code:: console

    cd C:/github_repos/LightGBM/examples/binary_classification
    "../../lightgbm.exe" config=train.conf data=binary.train valid=binary.test objective=binary device=gpu

.. image:: ./_static/images/screenshot-lightgbm-in-cli-with-gpu.png
   :align: center
   :target: ./_static/images/screenshot-lightgbm-in-cli-with-gpu.png
   :alt: A screenshot of the command prompt where a binary classification model is being trained using Light G B M.

Congratulations for reaching this stage!

To learn how to target a correct CPU or GPU for training, please see: `GPU SDK Correspondence and Device Targeting Table <./GPU-Targets.rst>`__.

--------------

Debugging LightGBM Crashes in CLI
---------------------------------

Now that you compiled LightGBM, you try it... and you always see a segmentation fault or an undocumented crash with GPU support:

.. image:: ./_static/images/screenshot-segmentation-fault.png
   :align: center
   :target: ./_static/images/screenshot-segmentation-fault.png
   :alt: A screenshot of the command prompt where a segmentation fault has occurred while using Light G B M.

Please check if you are using the right device (``Using GPU device: ...``). You can find a list of your OpenCL devices using `GPUCapsViewer`_, and make sure you are using a discrete (AMD/NVIDIA) GPU if you have both integrated (Intel) and discrete GPUs installed.
Also, try to set ``gpu_device_id = 0`` and ``gpu_platform_id = 0`` or ``gpu_device_id = -1`` and ``gpu_platform_id = -1`` to use the first platform and device or the default platform and device.
If it still does not work, then you should follow all the steps below.

You will have to redo the compilation steps for LightGBM to add debugging mode. This involves:

-  Deleting ``C:/github_repos/LightGBM/build`` folder

-  Deleting ``lightgbm.exe``, ``lib_lightgbm.dll``, and ``lib_lightgbm.dll.a`` files

.. image:: ./_static/images/screenshot-files-to-remove.png
   :align: center
   :target: ./_static/images/screenshot-files-to-remove.png
   :alt: A screenshot of the Light G B M folder with 1 folder and 3 files selected to be removed.

Once you removed the file, go into CMake, and follow the usual steps.
Before clicking "Generate", click on "Add Entry":

.. image:: ./_static/images/screenshot-added-manual-entry-in-cmake.png
   :align: center
   :target: ./_static/images/screenshot-added-manual-entry-in-cmake.png
   :alt: A screenshot of the Cache Entry popup where the name is set to CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE in all caps, the type is set to STRING in all caps and the value is set to Debug.

In addition, click on Configure and Generate:

.. image:: ./_static/images/screenshot-configured-and-generated-cmake.png
   :align: center
   :target: ./_static/images/screenshot-configured-and-generated-cmake.png
   :alt: A screenshot of the C Make window after clicking on configure and generate.

And then, follow the regular LightGBM CLI installation from there.

Once you have installed LightGBM CLI, assuming your LightGBM is in ``C:\github_repos\LightGBM``,
open a command prompt and run the following:

.. code:: console

    gdb --args "../../lightgbm.exe" config=train.conf data=binary.train valid=binary.test objective=binary device=gpu

.. image:: ./_static/images/screenshot-debug-run.png
   :align: center
   :target: ./_static/images/screenshot-debug-run.png
   :alt: A screenshot of the command prompt after the command above is run.

Type ``run`` and press the Enter key.

You will probably get something similar to this:

.. code:: text
