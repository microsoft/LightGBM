    X : {X_shape}

        A list of (X, y) tuple pairs to use as validation sets.
    eval_names : list of strings or None, optional (default=None)
        Names of eval_set.
    eval_sample_weight : list of arrays or None, optional (default=None)
        Weights of eval data.

        Init score of eval data.
    eval_group : list of arrays or None, optional (default=None)
        Group data of eval data.
    eval_metric : string, callable, list or None, optional (default=None)
        If string, it should be a built-in evaluation metric to use.
        If callable, it should be a custom evaluation metric, see note below for more details.
        If list, it can be a list of built-in metrics, a list of custom evaluation metrics, or a mix of both.
        In either case, the ``metric`` from the model parameters will be evaluated and used as well.
        Default: 'l2' for LGBMRegressor, 'logloss' for LGBMClassifier, 'ndcg' for LGBMRanker.
    early_stopping_rounds : int or None, optional (default=None)
        Activates early stopping. The model will train until the validation score stops improving.
        Validation score needs to improve at least every ``early_stopping_rounds`` round(s)
        to continue training.
        Requires at least one validation data and one metric.
        If there's more than one, will check all of them. But the training data is ignored anyway.

    verbose : bool or int, optional (default=True)
        Requires at least one evaluation data.

        If int, the eval metric on the eval set is printed at every ``verbose`` boosting stage.
        The last boosting stage or the boosting stage found by using ``early_stopping_rounds`` is also printed.

        .. rubric:: Example

        With ``verbose`` = 4 and at least one item in ``eval_set``,
        an evaluation metric is printed every 4 (instead of 1) boosting stages.

    feature_name : list of strings or 'auto', optional (default='auto')
        Feature names.
        If 'auto' and data is pandas DataFrame, data columns names are used.
    categorical_feature : list of strings or int, or 'auto', optional (default='auto')
        Categorical features.
        If list of int, interpreted as indices.
        If list of strings, interpreted as feature names (need to specify ``feature_name`` as well).
        If 'auto' and data is pandas DataFrame, pandas unordered categorical columns are used.
        All values in categorical features should be less than int32 max value (2147483647).
        Large values could be memory consuming. Consider using consecutive integers starting from zero.
        All negative values in categorical features will be treated as missing values.
        The output cannot be monotonically constrained with respect to a categorical feature.
    callbacks : list of callback functions or None, optional (default=None)
        List of callback functions that are applied at each iteration.
        See Callbacks in Python API for more information.

        learning_rate : float, optional (default=0.1)
            Boosting learning rate.
            You can use ``callbacks`` parameter of ``fit`` method to shrink/adapt learning rate
            in training using ``reset_parameter`` callback.

            Number of samples for constructing bins.
        objective : string, callable or None, optional (default=None)
            Specify the learning task and the corresponding learning objective or
            a custom objective function to be used (see note below).

        class_weight : dict, 'balanced' or None, optional (default=None)
            Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``.
            Use this parameter only for multi-class classification task;
            for binary classification task you may use ``is_unbalance`` or ``scale_pos_weight`` parameters.
            Note, that the usage of all these parameters will result in poor estimates of the individual class probabilities.
            You may want to consider performing probability calibration
            (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/calibration.html) of your model.
            The 'balanced' mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust weights
            inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``.
            If None, all classes are supposed to have weight one.
            Note, that these weights will be multiplied with ``sample_weight`` (passed through the ``fit`` method)
            if ``sample_weight`` is specified.
        min_split_gain : float, optional (default=0.)
            Minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree.
        min_child_weight : float, optional (default=1e-3)

            Subsample ratio of the training instance.
        subsample_freq : int, optional (default=0)
            Frequency of subsample, <=0 means no enable.

        Note
        ----
        A custom objective function can be provided for the ``objective`` parameter.
        In this case, it should have the signature
        ``objective(y_true, y_pred) -> grad, hess`` or
        ``objective(y_true, y_pred, group) -> grad, hess``:

            y_true : array-like of shape = [n_samples]
                The target values.
            y_pred : array-like of shape = [n_samples] or shape = [n_samples * n_classes] (for multi-class task)
                The predicted values.
                Predicted values are returned before any transformation,
                e.g. they are raw margin instead of probability of positive class for binary task.
            group : array-like
                Group/query data.
                Only used in the learning-to-rank task.
                sum(group) = n_samples.
                For example, if you have a 100-document dataset with ``group = [10, 20, 40, 10, 10, 10]``, that means that you have 6 groups,
                where the first 10 records are in the first group, records 11-30 are in the second group, records 31-70 are in the third group, etc.
            grad : array-like of shape = [n_samples] or shape = [n_samples * n_classes] (for multi-class task)
                The value of the first order derivative (gradient) of the loss
                with respect to the elements of y_pred for each sample point.
            hess : array-like of shape = [n_samples] or shape = [n_samples * n_classes] (for multi-class task)
                The value of the second order derivative (Hessian) of the loss
                with respect to the elements of y_pred for each sample point.

        For multi-class task, the y_pred is group by class_id first, then group by row_id.
        If you want to get i-th row y_pred in j-th class, the access way is y_pred[j * num_data + i]
        and you should group grad and hess in this way as well.
