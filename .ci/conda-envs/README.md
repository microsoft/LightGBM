# conda-envs

This directory contains files used to create `conda` environments for development
and testing of LightGBM.

The `.txt` files here are intended to be used with `conda create --file`.

For details on that, see the `conda` docs:

* `conda create` docs ([link](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/create.html))
* "Managing Environments" ([link](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html))
