LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms. It is designed to be distributed and efficient with the following advantages:

- Faster training speed and higher efficiency.
- Lower memory usage.
- Better accuracy.
- Support of parallel, distributed, and GPU learning.
- Capable of handling large-scale data.

For further details, please refer to [Features](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/blob/master/docs/Features.rst).

Benefiting from these advantages, LightGBM is being widely-used in many [winning solutions](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/blob/master/examples/README.md#machine-learning-challenge-winning-solutions) of machine learning competitions.

[Comparison experiments](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/blob/master/docs/Experiments.rst#comparison-experiment) on public datasets show that LightGBM can outperform existing boosting frameworks on both efficiency and accuracy, with significantly lower memory consumption. What's more, [distributed learning experiments](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/blob/master/docs/Experiments.rst#parallel-experiment) show that LightGBM can achieve a linear speed-up by using multiple machines for training in specific settings.
